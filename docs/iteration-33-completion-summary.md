## 🏗️ Architecture Implemented

### Core Security Components:
1. **SecurityDataCollectors** - 5-source data collection (auth, network, system, API, filesystem)
2. **ThreatDetectionEngine** - Multi-layer threat detection (signature + anomaly + behavioral + ML)
3. **SecurityIntelligenceAnalyzer** - Correlation analysis & risk assessment engine
4. **ResponseAutomationEngine** - Automated security responses & escalation policies
5. **SecurityBusinessBridge** - Security-to-business KPI translation layer

### Integration Layer:
- **AdvancedSecurityIntelligenceEngine** - Master orchestration engine
- **Cross-layer Coordination** - Integration with Real-time Intelligence & Auto-Policy engines
- **API Endpoints** - 6 REST endpoints for security operations
- **Server Integration** - Proper startup sequencing with existing systems

### Business Value Layer:
- **Executive Dashboard** - Security metrics → business insights translation
- **Compliance Reporting** - Automated regulatory compliance tracking
- **Risk Assessment** - Business impact calculation & prevention metrics
- **Strategic Intelligence** - Threat landscape analysis for business planning

## 📁 Files Created/Modified:

### Core Security Services:
- `server/services/strategy-security-intelligence-engine.ts` - Data collection & threat detection
- `server/services/strategy-security-intelligence-analyzer.ts` - Intelligence analysis & response
- `server/services/strategy-security-business-bridge.ts` - Business translation layer
- `server/services/strategy-advanced-security-intelligence.ts` - Master orchestration engine

### Validation Framework:
- `server/services/strategy-security-intelligence-validation.ts` - L1-L8 validation scenarios
- `server/services/strategy-security-intelligence-mocks.ts` - Mock services for testing

### API & Integration:
- `server/routes.ts` - Added 6 security API endpoints (`/api/security/*`)
- `server/index.ts` - Security engine startup integration (12-second delay)
- `package.json` - Added `validate:security:intelligence` script

## 🔗 Cross-layer Integration:

```typescript
// Integration with existing systems:
✅ Real-time Intelligence Engine - Data sharing & correlation
✅ Auto-Policy Evolution Engine - Policy-driven security responses  
✅ Observability Layer - Security metrics & monitoring
✅ CRM & Business Systems - Security impact on business operations
```
