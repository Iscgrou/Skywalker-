# Ripple Effect Analysis - Debt Snapshot Service (Iteration 1 Draft)
Date: 2025-08-12

## Changes (Planned)
- New table representative_debt_snapshots
- Snapshot capture service & APIs
- Integration with representative intelligence anomaly computation

## Expected Ripples
- Representative Intelligence: shifts from heuristic debt trend to statistical model (improves precision, lowers false positives).
- Orchestrator: richer repIntel context (version bump) enabling better prioritization of debt-related tasks.
- Storage: +1 table, daily write per active representative.

## Risk Assessment
- Write Amplification: daily batch acceptable; monitor size growth.
- Missing Captures: fallback heuristic ensures continuity.
- Anomaly Threshold Tuning: start with z>=2.0; adjust after empirical observation.

## Counterexample Mapping (Design Stage)
1. Missing snapshots -> no anomaly; confidence 0.
2. Single spike -> z high -> anomaly true.
3. Gradual increase -> z small -> anomaly false.
4. Very few snapshots (n<5) -> anomaly null.
5. Duplicate same day capture -> second ignored.

## Next Steps
Implement schema, service, integrate, run validation cycle, update with actual outcomes.
